# MLB Pitcher Classification

In this project, I seek to predict pitch result using the physical pitching dynamics of the MLB 2023 season. 

This project explores various machine learning techniques for classification on the statscast dataset.

Data Preparation: The project starts with data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure data quality.
Feature Engineering: Feature engineering is employed, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
Classification Models: Several classification algorithms are implemented and compared, including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Kernel SVM, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). 
The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
